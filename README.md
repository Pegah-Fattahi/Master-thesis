## Abstract 

The concept of sustainability has gained significant attention among people globally, and it is a major concern for various industries, including the fashion industry. Fashion companies have been criticized for their negative impact on the environment and society, such as high carbon footprints, water waste, and other related harmful impacts on the environment and society. Additionally, concerns about greenwashing have emerged, where companies only talk but do not take any action, or they do not disclose information to consumers. However, many fashion brands have taken steps to increase sustainability and share information about their practices with customers through various communication channels. This study employed a qualitative, inductive methodology to analyze how six German fashion brands approach sustainability initiatives and communication strategies with customers, and how they align with German government policy. The results show that the brands prioritize different SDGs, and there is significant variation in strategies to increase customer awareness and their alignment with German government sustainable policy. This study offers valuable insights for stakeholders, policymakers, and consumers and highlights the need for greater transparency and collaboration between fashion brands and governments.
